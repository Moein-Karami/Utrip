# Utrip
The project is a basic reservation program for hotels that consists of three phases. This last phase involves creating a web server based on HTTP protocol.

Attention: These programs probably won't compile due to organization of files;
you may write a new makefile to compile these programs, or just put all the .c, .cpp, .hpp, .h,
 from src/ and include/ and makefile to one directory.
